ðŸ›  Improvements & Fixes
âœ… Fixed an issue where post revisions triggered the post deletion handler

The handle_post_deletion() function now ignores post revisions by checking the post type (post_type !== 'revision').
This prevents unnecessary updates when WordPress auto-saves revisions or when users delete revisions manually.
âœ… Enhanced stability of the content update process

Ensured that the handle_post_deletion() function only executes when an actual post is deleted, reducing unnecessary file rewrites.
âœ… General code improvements

Added additional validation to prevent errors when handling deleted posts.
Optimized database queries for better performance.
