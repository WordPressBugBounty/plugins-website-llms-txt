Automatically generate and manage LLMS.txt files for LLM/AI content understanding, with full Yoast SEO and RankMath integration.

== Description ==

This plugin automatically generates an LLMs.txt file — a simple, structured list of important public URLs from your site — designed specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and other AI systems.
It works much like a traditional XML sitemap, but is optimized for the way AI agents read and learn from the web.

The plugin integrates seamlessly with popular SEO tools like Yoast SEO, Rank Math, and now AIOSEO, automatically excluding content marked as noindex or nofollow.

✅ Future-proof your site for AI discovery
✅ Lightweight, automatic, and customizable
✅ No need for manual configuration

New: llms.txt AI crawler detection
We now track whether major AI bots like GPTBot, ClaudeBot, and PerplexityBot are reading `llms.txt` files.

🛠 Improvements & Fixes

✅ Fixed issue with empty LLMS-generated files
	•	Resolved a bug where LLMS-generated files could appear empty if the rank_math_robots meta key was missing from posts.
	•	The plugin now correctly includes posts even if the Rank Math plugin is not installed or the meta field is not present.
	•	Prevented false negatives by ensuring the query accounts for both existing and non-existent rank_math_robots fields.

✅ Improved meta query logic for noindex handling
	•	Extended the meta_query to handle posts without the rank_math_robots key gracefully.
	•	Ensured that only posts explicitly marked as noindex are excluded, while all others (including those with no SEO plugin data) are properly included.

✅ Improved file generation accuracy
	•	Ensured that LLMS-related output files contain valid, expected content — reducing cases where generated files were blank due to strict filtering.
	•	Improved fallback logic for posts without SEO meta data.

🚀 This update ensures that LLMS-generated files remain accurate and complete, even on sites that don’t use Rank Math, and improves overall reliability when filtering content by SEO metadata.
